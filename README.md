# Loan_Payments
This program tells you how many months it will take you to pay off a given loan. It also calculates the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan. A loop is used to calculate the total amount of interest  and the size of debt after each month. My program outputs the monthly amount of interest paid remaining debt.
